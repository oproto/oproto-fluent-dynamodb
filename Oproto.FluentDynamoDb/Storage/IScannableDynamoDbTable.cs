/// Interface extending IDynamoDbTable with scan operations.

/// Scan operations are intentionally separated from the core table interface to implement
/// a friction pattern that discourages accidental usage. Scan operations read every item
/// in a table or index and can be very expensive in terms of consumed capacity and latency.
/// 
/// Use scan operations only for legitimate use cases such as:
/// - Data migration or ETL processes
/// - Analytics on small tables
/// - Operations where you truly need to examine every item
/// 
/// For most use cases, Query operations are more efficient and should be preferred.
