## Key Findings from Analysis

### Test File Statistics

**Total Test Files Analyzed:** 15  
**Total Tests:** 164

#### By Priority
- **Priority 1 (High Impact):** 3 files, 55 tests, 210 string assertions
- **Priority 2 (Medium Impact):** 3 files, 10 tests, 38 string assertions
- **Priority 3 (Review Needed):** 2 files, 23 tests, 97 string assertions
- **Priority 3 (Good As-Is):** 7 files, 87 tests (no migration needed)

#### Migration Scope
- **Files Requiring Migration:** 6 (Priority 1 & 2)
- **Tests Requiring Migration:** 65
- **String Assertions to Replace:** 248
- **Estimated Effort:** 15.5-20.5 hours

### Infrastructure Status

#### Already Available ✅
- **CompilationVerifier** - Ready to use, already used in 4 files
- **SemanticAssertions** - Ready to use, not yet used in any files
- **SemanticAssertionsTests** - 10 tests, all passing

#### Needs Adding
- Compilation verification in 2 files (DynamoDbSourceGeneratorTests, MapperGeneratorBugFixTests)

### String Assertion Patterns Identified

1. **Method Existence Checks** (~80 occurrences)
   - Pattern: `Should().Contain("public static")`
   - Migration: Replace with `ShouldContainMethod()`

2. **Assignment Checks** (~40 occurrences)
   - Pattern: `Should().Contain("entity.")`
   - Migration: Replace with `ShouldContainAssignment()`

3. **LINQ Usage Checks** (~25 occurrences)
   - Pattern: `Should().Contain(".Select(")`
   - Migration: Replace with `ShouldUseLinqMethod()`

4. **Type Reference Checks** (~15 occurrences)
   - Pattern: `Should().Contain("typeof(")`
   - Migration: Replace with `ShouldReferenceType()`

5. **DynamoDB Attribute Type Checks** (~50 occurrences) - **KEEP THESE**
   - Patterns: `S =`, `N =`, `SS =`, `NS =`, `L =`, `M =`
   - Migration: Keep but add "because" messages

6. **Null Handling Checks** (~20 occurrences) - **KEEP THESE**
   - Patterns: `!= null`, `Count > 0`
   - Migration: Keep but add "because" messages

7. **Key Format Checks** (~18 occurrences) - **KEEP THESE**
   - Pattern: `var keyValue = "prefix#" + value`
   - Migration: Keep but add "because" messages

## Requirements Satisfied

This task satisfies the following requirements from requirements.md:

- ✅ **Requirement 1.1:** Identified all test methods using `.Should().Contain()` for verifying generated code structure
- ✅ **Requirement 1.2:** Classified tests by priority (High, Medium, Low)
- ✅ **Requirement 1.3:** Created migration plan listing high-priority, medium-priority, and low-priority test files
- ✅ **Requirement 1.4:** Marked DynamoDB-specific string checks as acceptable to keep
- ✅ **Requirement 1.5:** Excluded tests that verify diagnostic messages or error conditions

## Conclusion

Task 1 is complete. A comprehensive migration tracking and analysis infrastructure has been created, including:

- Detailed documentation (50KB across 5 files)
- Automated analysis tool (analyze-tests.sh)
- Complete baseline metrics
- Clear migration patterns and examples
- Prioritized task list

The project is now ready to proceed with Task 2: Migrate MapperGeneratorTests.cs.

All documentation is located in `.kiro/specs/unit-test-fixes/` and is ready for use by developers working on the migration.
