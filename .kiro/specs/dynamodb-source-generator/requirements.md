# DynamoDB Source Generator Requirements

## Introduction

This feature adds source code generation capabilities to the Oproto.FluentDynamoDb library to dramatically reduce boilerplate code while maintaining AOT compatibility. The source generator will create entity mapping code, field name constants, key builders, and enhanced ExecuteAsync methods that provide a more EF/LINQ-like experience while preserving the existing fluent API for complex scenarios.

### Example Scenarios

**Multi-Item Entity Example:**
A `TransactionEntry` entity that contains multiple `LedgerEntry` objects. In DynamoDB, this is stored as:
- PK: `tenant123#txn#txn456` SK: `ledger789#line001` (first ledger entry)  
- PK: `tenant123#txn#txn456` SK: `ledger789#line002` (second ledger entry)
- PK: `tenant123#txn#txn456` SK: `ledger999#line003` (third ledger entry)

When querying with `ExecuteAsync<TransactionEntry>()`, all items with the same partition key are grouped and mapped into a single `TransactionEntry` object with a collection of `LedgerEntry` objects.

**Multi-Type Query Example:**
A table containing both `TransactionEntry` and `LedgerSummary` entities:
- PK: `tenant123#txn#txn456` SK: `ledger789#line001` (TransactionEntry data)
- PK: `tenant123#timeseries` SK: `ledger789` (LedgerSummary data)

When querying with `ExecuteAsync<TransactionEntry>()`, only items matching the TransactionEntry pattern are returned and mapped. The LedgerSummary items are filtered out automatically.

**Related Entity Example:**
A transaction entity with related child entities defined directly on it:
```csharp
[DynamoDbTable("transactions")]
public partial class TransactionEntry
{
    // Primary entity properties
    public Ulid TenantId { get; set; }
    public Ulid TransactionId { get; set; }
    public List<TransactionLedgerEntry> LedgerEntries { get; set; } // Multi-item entity
    
    // Related entities (populated based on what data is returned)
    [RelatedEntity(SortKeyPattern = "audit#*")]
    public List<AuditEntry>? AuditEntries { get; set; }
    
    [RelatedEntity(SortKeyPattern = "summary")]
    public LedgerSummary? Summary { get; set; }
}
```

When querying with `ExecuteAsync<TransactionEntry>()`, whatever items are returned by the query expression are automatically mapped to the appropriate properties based on their sort key patterns. If your query brings back audit entries, they'll be populated in `AuditEntries`. If not, the property remains null. This gives you full control through your query expression while automatically handling the complex mapping.

**Future LINQ Support Consideration:**
The attribute metadata design must be comprehensive enough to support future LINQ-style expressions like:
```csharp
// Future LINQ support - not implemented in this spec
var activeTransactions = await table
    .Where(t => t.TenantId == tenantId && t.Status == TransactionStatus.Active)
    .Include(t => t.AuditEntries)
    .OrderByDescending(t => t.CreatedDate)
    .Take(50)
    .ToListAsync<TransactionEntry>();
```

The attributes must capture sufficient metadata about types, relationships, indexes, and constraints to enable AOT-compatible LINQ expression translation in future versions.

## Glossary

- **Entity**: A C# class that represents data stored in DynamoDB, decorated with DynamoDB attributes
- **Source Generator**: A compile-time code generation tool that analyzes source code and generates additional C# code
- **Mapper**: Generated code that converts between C# objects and DynamoDB AttributeValue dictionaries
- **Field Constants**: Generated static string constants representing DynamoDB attribute names
- **Key Builders**: Generated static methods that construct DynamoDB partition and sort keys
- **Enhanced ExecuteAsync**: Generic versions of ExecuteAsync methods that automatically handle entity mapping
- **Multi-Item Entity**: A single logical entity that spans multiple DynamoDB items with the same partition key (e.g., Transaction with multiple LedgerEntries stored as separate items)
- **Single-Item Entity**: An entity that maps to exactly one DynamoDB item
- **Multi-Type Query**: A query that returns multiple different entity types from the same table (e.g., both Transaction and LedgerSummary entities)
- **Related Entity**: Secondary entities that can be optionally loaded and nested within a primary entity based on sort key patterns

- **IDynamoDbEntity**: Generated interface that entities implement to provide mapping capabilities
- **FluentResults Extension**: Optional package that wraps ExecuteAsync methods to return Result<T> instead of throwing exceptions
- **Source Generator**: A .NET Standard 2.0 analyzer project that generates code at compile time
- **Analyzer Package**: A NuGet package that includes both the main library and the source generator as an analyzer
- **LINQ Expression Metadata**: Comprehensive attribute information needed to translate LINQ expressions to DynamoDB queries in future versions
